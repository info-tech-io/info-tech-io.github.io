# Child #5: Integration Testing & Validation

**Child Issue**: https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/issues/7
**Epic**: #2 - Rebuild GitHub Pages Federation
**Status**: ‚è≥ Ready to Start (prerequisites complete)
**Estimated Duration**: ~2.25 days (7 stages)

## üîç Scope

### In Scope
1. **E2E Testing**: Complete federation lifecycle tests
2. **Performance Validation**: Build and load time verification
3. **User Experience Testing**: Navigation and styling validation
4. **Reliability Testing**: Failure scenarios and recovery
5. **Independence Testing**: Verify workflows don't interfere

### Out of Scope
- Unit testing (handled by Epic #15)
- Workflow creation (handled by Child #3, #4)
- Production deployment (handled by Child #6)

- Automated triggers functional
- Bug fix in hugo-templates validated

---

### Stage 4: User Experience Validation (0.25 day / 2 hours)
**Goal**: Validate user experience

**Tasks**:
- Navigation testing (all paths through federation)
- CSS & styling validation (all pages and contexts)
- Responsive design testing (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Deliverables**:

- `004-progress.md` - UX validation report with screenshots

**Success Criteria**:
- All navigation links work
- CSS styling correct everywhere
- Responsive on all devices
- Cross-browser compatible

---

### Stage 5: Performance Validation (0.25 day / 2 hours)
**Goal**: Measure and validate performance

**Tasks**:
- Build time measurement (both workflows)
- Page load time measurement (Lighthouse)
- Resource utilization measurement (GitHub Actions, artifacts)
- Performance baseline documentation

**Deliverables**:
- `005-performance-validation.md` - Stage plan
- `005-progress.md` - Performance metrics report

**Success Criteria**:
- Build times < 3 minutes
- Load times < 3 seconds
- Lighthouse scores > 90
- Within GitHub Actions limits

---

### Stage 6: Reliability Testing (0.25 day / 2 hours)
**Goal**: Test reliability and error handling

**Tasks**:
- Build failure scenarios (invalid JSON, missing files, Hugo errors)
- Deployment failure recovery testing
- Recovery procedures testing (rollback)
- Edge case testing (empty docs, large docs, concurrent mods)
- Error message validation

**Deliverables**:
- `006-reliability-testing.md` - Stage plan
- `006-progress.md` - Reliability test results

**Success Criteria**:
- Build failures handled gracefully
- Clear error messages
- Rollback procedures work
- Edge cases handled appropriately

---

### Stage 7: Results Documentation & Issue Creation (Ongoing / parallel)
**Goal**: Document results and create issues

**Tasks** (performed throughout Stages 1-6):
- Continuous results documentation
- GitHub issue creation for problems
- Compile testing summary
- Update Epic #2 progress
- Close Child #5 issue

**Deliverables**:
- `007-final-report.md` - Stage plan
- `007-progress.md` - Final testing summary

- User experience critical for adoption
- Stage 7 runs parallel - document as you go, don't batch
- Create GitHub issues immediately when problems found
- Production readiness assessment is key deliverable
- System-level validation, not deep unit testing
