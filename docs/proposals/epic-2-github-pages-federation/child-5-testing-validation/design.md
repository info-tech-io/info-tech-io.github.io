# Child #5: Integration Testing & Validation

**Child Issue**: https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/issues/7
**Epic**: #2 - Rebuild GitHub Pages Federation
**Status**: ⏳ Pending (blocked by Child #3, #4)
**Estimated Duration**: ~2 days

---

## 🎯 Child Objective

Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing and validation of complete GitHub Pages federation system to ensure both workflows work independently and together.

---

## 🔍 Scope

### In Scope
1. **E2E Testing**: Complete federation lifecycle tests
2. **Performance Validation**: Build and load time verification
3. **User Experience Testing**: Navigation and styling validation
4. **Reliability Testing**: Failure scenarios and recovery
5. **Independence Testing**: Verify workflows don't interfere

### Out of Scope
- Unit testing (handled by Epic #15)
- Workflow creation (handled by Child #3, #4)
- Production deployment (handled by Child #6)

- Correct content in correct locations
- Atomic deployments verified

---

#### 2. Performance Tests
**Goal**: Validate performance metrics

**Test Scenarios**:
- Measure corporate site build time (target: < 3 min)
- Measure documentation federation build time (target: < 3 min)
- Measure site load time (target: < 3 sec)
- Measure resource utilization

**Success Criteria**:
- All performance targets met
- No degradation from baseline
- Acceptable resource usage

---

#### 3. User Experience Tests
**Goal**: Ensure excellent UX

#### 4. Reliability Tests
**Goal**: Verify error handling and recovery

**Test Scenarios**:
- Build failure recovery
- Deployment failure rollback
- Partial content scenarios
- Network failure handling

**Success Criteria**:
- Graceful failures
- Automatic rollback working
- No partial deployments
- Clear error messages

---
