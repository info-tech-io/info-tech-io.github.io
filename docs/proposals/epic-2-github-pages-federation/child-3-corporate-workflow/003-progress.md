# Stage 3: Repository Dispatch Integration - Progress Report

**Status**: ✅ Complete (Pre-existing)
**Started**: Previously implemented
**Verified**: 2025-10-26
**Duration**: N/A (already exists)

---

## Summary

Repository dispatch integration was already implemented in info-tech repository. Verified existing workflow configuration and integration with hub repository.

## Tasks Status

- ✅ Task 1: Create notify workflow in info-tech repo (pre-existing)
- ✅ Task 2: Create GitHub token (PAT_TOKEN configured)
- ⚠️  Task 3: Test repository dispatch (requires manual testing)
- ⚠️  Task 4: End-to-end test (deferred to Stage 4)
- ✅ Task 5: Add logging and monitoring (included in workflow)

## Deliverable

- ✅ **File**: `.github/workflows/notify-hub.yml` (in info-tech repo)
- ✅ **Status**: Exists and configured (25 lines)
- ✅ **Implementation**:
  - Uses `peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v3` action
  - Triggers on push to main branch
  - Filters by `docs/**` path changes
  - Sends `corporate-site-updated` event type
  - Includes client payload with repository, ref, and sha

## Implementation Details

**Workflow Configuration**:
```yaml
name: Notify Hub of Corporate Site Update
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['docs/**']
event-type: corporate-site-updated
token: PAT_TOKEN (configured as secret)
```

**Integration Points**:
- Source: info-tech repository (`docs/**` changes)
- Target: info-tech-io.github.io repository
- Trigger: `repository_dispatch` with type `corporate-site-updated`
- Authentication: PAT_TOKEN secret

**Advantages of Current Implementation**:
- Uses official GitHub action (more reliable than curl)
- Automatic retry logic
- Better error handling
- Cleaner YAML syntax

## Testing Notes

Manual testing required to verify:
1. PAT_TOKEN has proper permissions
2. Dispatch successfully triggers hub workflow
3. End-to-end flow works (info-tech push → hub deploy)

These tests will be performed in Stage 4 (Testing & Validation).

## Next Action

Proceed to Stage 4: Testing and validation
