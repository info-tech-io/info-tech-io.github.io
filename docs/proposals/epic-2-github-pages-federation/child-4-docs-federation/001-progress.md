## Summary

Stage 1 completed successfully. Created complete GitHub Actions workflow for parallel multi-product documentation deployment with Download-Merge-Deploy pattern.

## Tasks Status

- ✅ Task 1: Create workflow file structure
- ✅ Task 2: Download current pages state
- ✅ Task 3: Setup build environment
- ✅ Task 4: Clone product documentation repositories
- ✅ Task 5: Build all product documentation in parallel
- ✅ Task 6: Create documentation hub (placeholder)
- ✅ Task 7: Selective merge with preservation
- ✅ Task 8: Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Task 9: Error handling

## Deliverable

- ✅ **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs-federation.yml` (385 lines)
- ✅ **Status**: Created and committed
- ✅ **Commit**: 23b9578

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Features
- **Triggers**:
  - 4 repository_dispatch event types (quiz-docs-updated, hugo-templates-docs-updated, web-terminal-docs-updated, cli-docs-updated)
  - Manual workflow_dispatch with product selection and debug mode
- **Parallel Processing**: Background jobs for cloning 4 product repositories simultaneously
- **Build System**: Integration with hugo-templates federated-build.sh
- **Documentation Hub**: Placeholder hub created with basic navigation (to be enhanced in Stage 3)
- **Merge Strategy**: rsync-based selective merge preserving corporate site at root
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive cleanup and notification on failure

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel repository cloning (4 concurrent)
- Parallel documentation builds via federated-build.sh
- Incremental deployment (docs only, preserves root)

### Validation
- Current site state verification
- Build output validation (HTML file count, index.html presence)
- Merge result verification (corporate site preserved, all products deployed)
- Final structure verification with detailed logging

## Testing

**Next**: Manual workflow trigger test required to verify:
1. Workflow syntax validity
2. Repository cloning success
3. Federated build execution
4. Documentation hub generation
5. Selective merge functionality
6. GitHub Pages deployment

## Notes

- Based on proven Child #3 corporate workflow pattern
- All 9 tasks from plan implemented
- Ready for Stage 2 (Configuration validation)
- Documentation hub currently uses placeholder HTML (enhancement in Stage 3)

## Next Action

Proceed to Stage 2: Configuration file validation and product module.json verification
