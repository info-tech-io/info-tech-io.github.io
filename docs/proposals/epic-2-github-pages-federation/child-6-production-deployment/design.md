# Child #6: Production Deployment & Monitoring

**Child Issue**: https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/issues/8
**Epic**: #2 - Rebuild GitHub Pages Federation
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending (blocked by Child #5)
**Estimated Duration**: ~2 days

---

## üéØ Child Objective

Deploy validated GitHub Pages federation architecture to production with comprehensive monitoring, operational runbooks, and legacy workflow cleanup.

---

## üîç Scope

### In Scope
1. **Production Deployment**: Activate both workflows in production
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement health monitoring and alerting
3. **Operational Runbooks**: Create procedures for common operations
4. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove old federation workflows
5. **Documentation Finalization**: Update all docs with production info

### Out of Scope
- Testing (handled by Child #5)
- Workflow development (handled by Child #3, #4)
- Ongoing maintenance (part of standard operations)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Production Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Review Child #5 test results
2. Verify all acceptance criteria met
3. Confirm stakeholder approval
4. Prepare rollback plan

---

### Phase 2: Production Activation
**Duration**: 4 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Enable corporate workflow in production
2. Trigger initial corporate site deploy
3. Validate deployment successful
4. Enable documentation workflow
5. Trigger initial docs federation deploy
6. Validate complete federation

---

### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup
**Duration**: 4 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Configure GitHub Actions monitoring
2. Setup failure alerts (email/Slack)
3. Create health check dashboard
4. Configure deployment notifications

**Monitoring Components**:
- Workflow execution status
- Build success/failure rates
- Deployment times
- Site availability
- Error logs

---

### Phase 4: Operational Runbooks
**Duration**: 4 hours

**Tasks**:
Create runbooks for:
1. **Routine Operations**:
   - Manual workflow trigger
   - Content update procedures
   - Deployment verification

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Build failures
   - Deployment failures
   - CSS issues
   - Content conflicts

3. **Emergency Procedures**:
   - Rollback to previous deployment
   - Disable workflows
   - Contact escalation

---

### Phase 5: Legacy Cleanup
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Disable old `deploy-complete-federation.yml`
2. Archive legacy workflows
3. Update README and documentation
4. Remove obsolete configuration files

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Both workflows active in production
- [ ] Complete federation deployed and verified
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Runbooks created and validated
- [ ] Legacy workflows cleaned up
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Workflow Health**:
   - Success rate (target: > 99%)
   - Average build time
   - Failure frequency

2. **Site Health**:
   - Availability (target: 99.9%)
   - Load time (target: < 3 sec)
   - Error rate (target: < 0.1%)

3. **Content Health**:
   - Last update time
   - Content freshness
   - Link validity

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: Workflow Failure
    condition: workflow.status == 'failure'
    notify: devops-team
    severity: high

  - name: Slow Build
    condition: workflow.duration > 5min
    notify: devops-team
    severity: medium

  - name: Site Down
    condition: site.status != 200
    notify: oncall
    severity: critical
```

## üìö Operational Runbooks

### Runbook Structure
Each runbook will include:
1. **Purpose**: What this procedure does
2. **Prerequisites**: What's needed
3. **Steps**: Detailed instructions
4. **Verification**: How to confirm success
5. **Rollback**: How to undo if needed
6. **Escalation**: Who to contact for help

### Key Runbooks to Create
1. `runbooks/manual-deployment.md`
2. `runbooks/troubleshooting-build-failures.md`
3. `runbooks/troubleshooting-deployment-issues.md`
4. `runbooks/rollback-procedure.md`
5. `runbooks/adding-new-product-docs.md`
